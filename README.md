## üìñ Project Overview
### ExesMan addresses the common challenges associated with manual expense processes, which are often time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack transparency. This system provides a robust solution with:

- Role-Based Access Control (Admin, Manager, Employee)
- Configurable, Multi-Level Approval Workflows
- Support for Conditional Approval Rules
- OCR for automatic receipt scanning
- Multi-Currency support with automatic conversion

## ‚ú® Features

- Authentication & User Management
- Signup/Login for all user roles.
- The first signup automatically creates the Company and the first Admin account.

#### The Admin can:

- Create Employees & Managers.
- Assign and change user roles.
- Define manager-employee reporting relationships.

#### Expense Submission (Employee)

- Submit detailed expense claims (Amount, Category, Description, Date, Receipt).
- View a complete history of their expenses with their current status (Approved, Rejected, Pending).
- Utilize OCR to auto-read and pre-fill expense details from uploaded receipts.

#### Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin)

- Handle multi-level approvals (e.g., Manager ‚Üí Finance ‚Üí Director).
- Implement powerful conditional rules:
- Percentage rule (e.g., approved if 60% of approvers agree).
- Specific approver rule (e.g., auto-approved if the CFO approves).
- Hybrid rules that combine both percentage and specific approver logic.

#### Currency Handling

- The company's default currency is set on signup.
- Employees can submit expenses in any currency.
- The system uses an external API for real-time exchange rates to automatically convert and display amounts in the company's default currency for approvers.
